    Inspired by <a
            href="http://skinnyski.com">Skinnyski.com</a>, this site was
        created to
        help
        fat bikers
        share
    trail conditions. Winter riding conditions change frequently; the
    best way to stay informed about the good snow and best trails
    is through sharing of information by those who are riding the
    trails. Please contribute in any way that you can!
