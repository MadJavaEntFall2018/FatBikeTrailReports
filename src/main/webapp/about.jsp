    Inspired by <a
            href="http://skinnyski.com">Skinnyski.com</a>, this site was
        created to
        help
        fat bikers
        share
    trail conditions. Winter riding conditions change frequently; the
    best way to stay informed about the good snow and best trails
    is through sharing of information by those who are grooming and/or riding the
    trails. Please contribute in any way that you can!
